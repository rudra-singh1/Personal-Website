# Personal Website

Link: https://rudrasingh.netlify.app/

To create my personal website, I utilized:
* React and Next.js for UI development
* Tailwind CSS for styling and HTML
* Node.js for server-side functionality
* Git will handle version control
* CDN for deploying the site

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits and save using "Ctrl-S".\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
App is ready to be deployed!
